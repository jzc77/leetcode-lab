# LeetCode Lab
## About
This repo contains a collection of my Leetcode solutions in **Java**

## My approach
I am working my way through all the Neetcode problems (https://neetcode.io/practice)
and CodingBat Java problems (https://codingbat.com/java).

I provide my thought process before starting my solution for Neetcode problems.
This is a way for me to organize my thoughts.

I also provide my first attempt (usually brute force). Then I will either think up a way to solve it more efficiently
or I would partially watch the corresponding solution video for a hint.
